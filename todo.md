# To do / decide on

The three templates differ from the extend of information given. Ideally the three templates are more/well aligned and all comply with TUD regulations and huisstijl. Moreover, they should contain information on the author's journey, copyrights, plagiarism and a useful help by providing a well organized cheat sheet. To what extend do we want authors to choose their own format/style (deviating from TUD huisstijl)?

GitHub and GitLab have both their merits and trade offs. I guess we can allow both given a few boundary conditions. Do we want 'automatically' a copy to gitlab (if possible at all to make that mandatory)?

2nd editions: define tags, archiving. 

Option: OCW/dev with page output is open to anyone, through the DM. Dan GH private.
