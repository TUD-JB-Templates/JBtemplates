# Which template do I use?

We offer three templates, each with its own (dis)advantages. We specify below the characteristics in order to help you pick the 'best' template that fits your needs and level of expertise.

All templates provide the same starting chapters, telling a little about the markdown language, and providing some exercises to help you get started.


## Jupyter Demo Book
The Jupyter Demo Book template (developed by Timon Idema) is based on the Jupyter Book 1 software and utilizes TU Delft Gitlab. Full software installation is required to produce 

Positives:
- bare bone version
- software developed and support by JB1 developers

Negatives:
- Full software installation to see output
- No full control unless coded yourself
- Difficult to set up
- OIT support needed to get started
- PDF export suboptimal

Example book made utilizing the template: [A Brief Introduction to Biochemistry: Biochemistry for non-chemists](https://interactivetextbooks.tudelft.nl/biochemistry)

## Teachbooks
The Teachbooks template (developed by Tom van Woudenberg, Robert Lanzafame and Dennis den Ouden-van der Horst) is based on the Jupyter Book 1 software and utilizes Microsoft Github. It is recommended to install full software to run the book locally, but is not required through the use of GitHub Pages.
