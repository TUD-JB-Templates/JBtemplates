- think about your plan
- is it a self-contained educational textbook (OIT) or is it more of a reader (OCW)?
- do you want to publish it open access (with what restrictions, if any?)
- what is your level of expertise in terms of python, markdown, jupyter, git? This determines whether it is better to build on your local computer of online.
- what do you need help with?
- do you want to test the materials with students, so behind sso?
